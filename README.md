I received your code, and built the project using Tianguo_ConfigBooks.xls and readme.txt files.
And then I did run admin_executor_service, but it is incorrect.
So I added a png file for screenshot to git.
Please check it and let me know the resolution.
And I need to send me pull project including build directory because of settings of cfg and dat file.

Thank you.

Urgent!!!
In the festival period, C version app sometime has following exception when a user is entering a room:

  SIP EXCEPTION(3:RenderingAPIException): Error creating texture: Ran out of memory in D3D9Texture::_createNormTex at SipD3D9Texture.cpp (line 1075)

Let me know the reason and send me a resolved code ASAP.

HI.
Give me unixODBC-devel package(rpm) for CentOS with which contains all of its dependencies, please.

Example for Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install unixodbc unixodbc-dev

Example for CentOS:
sudo yum install unixODBC-devel

Example for Fedora:
sudo dnf install unixODBC-devel

# 12-28
I uploaded unixODBC of Centos 7. If you need another package to install that, then tell me.
